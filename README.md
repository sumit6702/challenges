# challenges

This project is a personal challenge where I aim to complete various projects and assess my ability to deliver them. Think of it as a personal coding tournament! üèÜ

## Description

I'm challenging myself to complete a series of projects to improve my skills and see what I can accomplish. This repository will house the code and documentation for these challenges.

## Current Challenge:

*   **Windows Notepad Clone - Web Based:** Recreating the functionality of Windows Notepad in a web browser. üìù

## Upcoming Challenges:

*   Unknown... ü§î Stay tuned!

## Installation

Since the primary language is currently unknown and there's no `package.json`, specific installation instructions are not yet available. However, for the current challenge (Notepad Clone), you'll likely need a web browser.

**Prerequisites (for the Notepad Clone):**

*   A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, etc.)

**Installation Steps (for the Notepad Clone):**

1.  Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/sumit6702/challenges.git`
2.  Navigate to the Notepad Clone project directory (once it's available).
3.  Open the `index.html` file (or equivalent) in your web browser.

## Key Features (Notepad Clone - Web Based):

*   Basic text editing functionality (typing, deleting, copying, pasting).
*   Saving and loading text files (implementation details may vary).
*   Simple user interface.
